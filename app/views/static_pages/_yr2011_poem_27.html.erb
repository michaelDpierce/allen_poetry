<h1>The Fairest To The Fairest Of My Soul</h1>

  <div class='well'>
    <p>The sweat dripping from me</p>
    <p>After I awoke, I splashed the water onto my face</p>
    <p>I thought I felt different, but in the moonlight the blur is clear</p>
    <p>I'm not who I used to be</p>
    <p>I thought it was in the writing</p>
    <p>But I'm just not</p>
    <p>The voices creep in</p>
    <p>Screaming, screaming, screaming</p>
    <p>NO YOU ARE NOT, NO YOU ARE NOT, NO YOU ARE NOT</p>
  </div>
