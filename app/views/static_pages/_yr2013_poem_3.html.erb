    <p>Run to the desert and you will be all that you need to be.</p>
    <p>Run to the desert and you will see all that you need to see.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It's the journey that defines the man.</p>
    <p>blood, soul and sand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Heart of stone.</p>
    <p>House of glass.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The flesh and bone</p>
    <p>All wll be transformed</p>
    <p>So run run your little heart</p>
    <p>be free be free, on my dear boy</p>
