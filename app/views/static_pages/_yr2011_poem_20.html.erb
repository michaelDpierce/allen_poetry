    <p>Changing yourself</p>
    <p>How many lives do you see?</p>
    <p>Is there one who is caring?</p>
    <p>One who watched the world go by?</p>
    <p>Oh, there is one who must always be right.</p>
    <p>One to find the light.</p>
    <p>Who are you..</p>
    <p>How many lives do you see?</p>
    <p>There is one who lives on the beach.</p>
    <p>One who has my heart.</p>
    <p>And one who will never let it go free.</p>
