<h1>Life Choices</h1>

  <div class='well'>

        Sometimes I sit and stare, imagining all the lives I could of lived,
        the happiness I could of had, the soft kiss of a lovers lips or the
        consuming power of a politicianâ€™s word. All that is outside of me.
        All the lost opportunity.
