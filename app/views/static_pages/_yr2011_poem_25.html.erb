  <div class='well'>
    <p>My heart feels heavy, like a stone cast in a perfect pond</p>
    <p>Walking through this life, a scarecrow am I</p>
    <p>Why can't a man live free, I know it's what you leave behind</p>
    <p>But it's all depending on how you act and how you treat yourself</p>
    <p>So baby, I know its me</p>
    <p>I know it's not you</p>
    <p>Please, let me explain myself to everyone</p>
    <p>Because when I call for you, I want you to come</p>
