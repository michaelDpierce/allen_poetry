  <div class='well'>
    <p>
        Does the lion feel anything ripping out the neck of some frivolous
        man.
    </p>
    <p>If you could change the days, would you dare to make it different</p>
    <p>We keep resisting</p>
    <p>Trying to survive in a hopeless world</p>
    <p>But life is no better, with a forced or fake smile</p>
    <p>Aren't you envious of the nameless beast?</p>
    <p>Laying in the pool of blood that once was?</p>
    <p>Lavished in its victory...</p>
