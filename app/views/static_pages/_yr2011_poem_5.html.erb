  <div class='well'>

    <p>I know its freezing, but I think we have to walk</p>
    <p>We are waving but nobody wants to stop</p>
    <p>I know this little place though, where we can escape to</p>
    <p>So lets gamble, you can count on me, its quite alright</p>
    <p>By the morning its such a drag, but the medication is just not the same</p>
